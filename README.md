# Getting Started

Welcome to this basic HTML5 and Repository/Version Control starters guide.

## What is in a Read Me?

For more info on the purpose of a README.ms file and best practices, check out [this resource](https://www.makeareadme.com/). You can also check [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for basic markdown syntax. Markdown is the industry standard language for writing a README file.

## Getting Started Next Steps

* Choose a google font of your choice and add to your project following [these guidelines](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/using_type/using_web_fonts).
* Add a second google font. Set one as the default font for header elements and the other for all other text. For those of you without prior HTML experience, [this cheat sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) is a good resource.
* Add a reset style sheet to your project. Some good starting options are [reset css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). You can read about the consept behind and purpose of a reset style sheet [here](https://cssdeck.com/blog/what-is-a-css-reset/).
